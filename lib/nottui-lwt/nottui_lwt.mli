(** Nottui_lwt exposes an Lwt-driven mainloop.

    UI execution is done in an Lwt thread and UI events can spawn and
    synchronize threads.

type event = [
  | `Key of Unescape.key
  | `Mouse of Unescape.mouse
  | `Paste of Unescape.paste
  | `Resize of int * int
]

val render : ?quit:unit Lwt.t -> size:int * int -> event Lwt_stream.t -> ui Lwd.t -> image Lwt_stream.t
(** Turn a stream of events into a stream of images. *)

val run : (*?term:Term.t ->*) ?cursor:(int * int) Lwd.var -> ?quit:unit Lwt.t -> ui Lwd.t -> unit Lwt.t
(** Run mainloop in [Lwt], until the [quit] promise is fulfilled.

    The ui is a normal [Lwd.t] value, but events are free to spawn asynchronous
    [Lwt] threads.
