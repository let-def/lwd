(* Sequence construction

   [Lwd_seq] implements a type of ordered collections with a pure interface.
   In addition, changes to collections are easy to track.

   A collection can be transformed with the usual map, filter and fold
   combinators. If later, the transformation is applied again to an updated
   collection, shared elements (in the sense of physical sharing), the
   result of the previous transformation will be reused for these elements.

   The book-keeping overhead is O(n) in the number of changes, so O(1) per
   element.

type +'a seq = 'a t

(* A sequence with no element. *)
val empty : 'a seq

(* A singleton sequence. The physical identity of the element is considered
   when reusing previous computations.

   If you do:
     let x1 = element x
     let x2 = element x

   Then x1 and x2 are seen as different elements and no sharing will be done
   during transformation.
*)
val element : 'a -> 'a seq

(* Concatenate two sequences into a bigger one.
   As for [element], the physical identity of a sequence is considered for
   reuse.
*)
val concat : 'a seq -> 'a seq -> 'a seq

(* Look at the contents of a sequence *)

type ('a, 'b) view =
  | Empty
  | Element of 'a
  | Concat of 'b * 'b

module Balanced : sig
  (* A variant of the sequence type that guarantees that the depth of
     transformation, as measured in the number of [concat] nodes, grows in
     O(log n) where n is the number of elements in the sequnce.

     This is useful to prevent stack overflows and to avoid degenerate cases
     where a single element change, but it is at the end of a linear sequence
     of [concat] nodes, thus making the total work O(n).
     For instance, in:

       [concat e1 (concat e2 (concat e3 (... (concat e_n))...))]

     If [e_n] changes, the whole spine has to be recomputed.

     Using [Balanced.concat], the representation will be re-balanced
     internally. Then [Balanced.view] should be used to access the balanced
     sequence.

     When working with balanced sequences in a transformation pipeline, it is
     only useful to balance the first sequence of the pipeline. Derived
     sequence will have a depth bounded by the depth of the first one.

(* Lwd interface.

   All sequences live in [Lwd] monad: if a sequence changes slightly, parts
   that have not changed will not be re-transformed.
*)

(* [fold ~map ~reduce] transforms a sequence.
   If the sequence is non-empty, the [map] function is applied to element nodes
   and the [reduce] function is used to combine transformed concatenated nodes.
   If the sequence is empty, None is returned.

(* Low-level interface *)

module Reducer : sig
  (* The interface allows to implement incremental sequence transformation
     outside of the [Lwd] monad.
     Actually, the Lwd functions above are implemented on top of this
     interface.
  *)

  (* A [('a, 'b) reducer] value stores the state necessary to incrementally
     transform an ['a seq] to ['b].
     In essence, the Lwd functions just hide a reducer value.
  *)
  type ('a, 'b) reducer

  (* A new reducer that transforms sequences with the given [map] and [reduce]
     functions.  The reducer starts from the [empty] sequence.  *)
  val make : map:('a -> 'b) -> reduce:('b -> 'b -> 'b) -> ('a, 'b) reducer

  (* Updates the [reducer] to transform another sequence.
     Intermediate nodes are reused when possible.
     Only the "reuse plan" is computed by [update], actual transformation is
     done by the [reduce] function.
   *)
  val update : ('a, 'b) reducer -> 'a seq -> ('a, 'b) reducer

  (* Returns the reduced ['b] value if the sequence is non-empty or [None] if
     the sequence is empty.
     Because transformation is done lazily, [reduce] is the only function
     that can call [map] and [reduce].
   *)
  val reduce : ('a, 'b) reducer -> 'b option

  (* Sometimes it is important to track the elements that disappeared from a
     sequence. The ['b dropped] type represent all the intermediate result that
     were referenced by a reducer and are no longer after an update.
